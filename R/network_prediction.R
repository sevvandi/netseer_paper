#' Predicts a graph from a time series of graphs.
#'
#' This function predicts the graph at a future time step using a time series of
#' graphs.
#'
#' @param graphlist A list of graphs in igraph format.
#' @param formulation Formulation 2 includes an additional condition constraining total
#' edges by the predicted value. Formulation 1 does not have that constraint. Formulation 2
#' gives more realistic graphs due to that constraint. Default is set to \code{2}.
#' @param conf_level1 A value between 50 and 100 denoting the confidence interval
#' for the number of predicted nodes in the graph. If set to \code{NULL} the predicted
#' graph has the mean number of predicted nodes. If set to \code{80} for example,
#' there would be 3 predicted graphs. One with mean number of predicted nodes, and
#' the other two with the number of nodes corresponding to lower and upper
#' confidence bounds.
#' @param conf_level2 The upper confidence bound for the degree distribution. Default
#' set to \code{90}.
#' @param dense_opt If set to \code{2} the dense option in R package \code{lpSolve}
#' will be used.
#' @param weights_opt Weights option ranging from 1 to 6 used for different edge weight
#' schemes. Weights option 1 uses uniform weights for all edges. Option 2 uses binary
#' weights. If the edge existed in a past graph, then weight is set to 1. Else set to
#' 0. All possible new edges are assigned weight 1. Option 3 is a more selective
#' version. Option 4 uses proportional weights according to the history. Option 5 uses
#' proportional weights, but as the network is more in the past, it gives less weight.
#' Option 5 uses linearly decaying proportional weights. Option 6 uses harmonically decaying
#' weights. That is the network at \code{T} is given weight 1,  \code{T-1}
#' is given weight 1/2 and so on. Option 7 uses 1 for edges that are present in the last
#' graph. Option 8 is a slightly different to Option 7. It uses 1 for edges in the last seen graph and the \code{weights_param} for new edges. Default is set to \code{8}.
#' @param weights_param The weight given for possible edges from new vertices. Default
#' set to \code{0.001}.
#' @param h The prediction time step. Default is \code{ h = 1}.
#'
#'
#' @return A list of predicted graphs. If \code{conf_level1} is not \code{NULL}, then
#' 3 graphs are returned one with the mean number of predicted nodes and the other 2
#' with the number of nodes equal to the lower and upper bound values of prediction.
#' If If \code{conf_level1} is \code{NULL}, only the mean predicted graph is returned.
